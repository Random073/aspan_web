  <h1><strong>Privacy Policy for ASpan</strong></h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 03.02.2025</p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 03.02.2025</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Welcome to ASpan.</strong> ASpan is a non-profit educational
    platform (available as a mobile app and via a promotional website) dedicated
    to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
    use, store, and protect your personal information when you use ASpan (“the
    platform,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to complying with
    applicable privacy laws and regulations, including those designed to protect
    children under 16 (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation’s
    provisions for children (GDPR-K) and the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy
    Protection Act (COPPA)). By using ASpan, you agree to the practices
    described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note for Minors:</strong> If you are under 16 years old, please
    review this Policy with a parent or guardian. ASpan does not knowingly
    collect personal information from children under 13 without parental
    consent, and by using ASpan you confirm that you are at least 16 years old
    or have your parent/guardian’s permission to use the platform and provide
    your personal data.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></h2>

  <p>
    We <strong>collect only the minimum personal data necessary</strong> to
    create and manage your ASpan account and improve your learning experience.
    This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Username:</strong> A display name or nickname you provide when
      creating an account.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for account verification, login, and
      essential communications (e.g. password resets or important service
      updates).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Password:</strong> A password you choose to secure your account.
      <em
        >For your safety, passwords are stored in a secure, hashed form and
        <strong>not</strong> in plain text.</em
      >
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Last Activity Date:</strong> A timestamp or date of your last
      activity or login on the platform. This is collected automatically to help
      us understand platform usage and manage inactive accounts.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All personal data is stored securely in our
    <strong>AppWrite database</strong>, which is a cloud-based data storage
    service. We do <strong>not</strong> collect any sensitive personal
    information such as physical addresses, phone numbers, payment details, or
    government IDs. We also do not collect any unnecessary data from your device
    – for example, we <strong>do not track</strong> your precise location,
    contacts, or device identifiers beyond what is needed for the basic
    functioning of the service.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>2. How We Use Your Information</strong></h2>

  <p>
    We use the collected information
    <strong
      >solely to provide and improve the ASpan educational service.</strong
    >
    Specifically, your information is used to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Create and Manage Your Account:</strong> We use your username,
      email, and password to set up your account, authenticate your login, and
      allow you to use the app’s features (such as saving progress or
      preferences).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Provide the Educational Services:</strong> Your data allows us to
      deliver personalized content (if applicable) and keep track of your
      activity (using the last activity date) so that you can continue where you
      left off and we can ensure the platform is functioning properly for you.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Communicate with You:</strong> We may send you
      <strong>essential communications</strong> related to the service. For
      example, we might send a verification email when you register, an email to
      reset your password if you request it, or to inform you of important
      updates like changes to this Privacy Policy. We will
      <strong>not</strong> send you marketing or promotional emails, and there
      are <strong>no advertisements</strong> within the app.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Improve and Maintain Our Platform:</strong> Aggregated data such
      as usage statistics (e.g., how many users are active, using the last
      activity date) may be used to help us understand user engagement and
      improve ASpan’s features or performance. This data is
      <strong>not</strong> personally identifying beyond the purposes above, and
      it is used internally by our team to make the app better for users.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Non-Profit, No Monetization:</strong> ASpan is strictly a non-profit
    initiative. There are
    <strong>no in-app purchases, no subscription fees, and no ads</strong> on
    our platform. This means
    <strong>we do not monetize your personal information</strong> in any way. We
    do not use your data for advertising, nor do we profile you for marketing
    purposes. All usage of your data is solely to serve you as an educational
    tool.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>3. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></h2>

  <p>
    Your privacy is extremely important to us. We treat your personal data as
    confidential and
    <strong
      >do not share, sell, or rent your personal information to any third
      parties</strong
    >
    for their own marketing or other purposes. In other words,
    <strong
      >no one outside of ASpan’s operation will receive your personal
      data</strong
    >
    for independent use.
  </p>
  <p>The only circumstances under which we might disclose user data are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Service Providers (Processors):</strong> ASpan uses certain
      trusted service providers to operate the platform – most notably, our
      AppWrite cloud database service where your data is stored. In such cases,
      the service provider is
      <strong>acting under our direction and on our behalf</strong>. They are
      <strong>not allowed to use your information for any other purpose</strong>
      except to store or process it for us, and they are bound by strict
      confidentiality and data protection obligations. Aside from these
      infrastructure providers, we currently do not use any analytics services,
      advertising networks, or other third-party tools that would require access
      to your personal data.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if
      required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request (e.g., a
      court order, subpoena, or government demand) or to protect the rights,
      property, or safety of ASpan, our users, or the public. For instance, if
      we are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement or regulatory
      authorities, we will only provide the minimum necessary information and
      only when legally compelled.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Business Transfer:</strong> Since ASpan is non-profit and not a
      commercial enterprise, a sale or merger is unlikely. However, if there
      were ever a situation where ASpan’s ownership or structure changes (for
      example, if it is transferred to a non-profit educational organization or
      combined with another project), user data might be transferred to the new
      owner/organization. If that happens, we will ensure the same level of
      privacy protection is maintained and inform users of any changes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Aside from the above scenarios,
    <strong>no other sharing of data occurs.</strong> Specifically, we do not
    share user information with advertisers, data brokers, or unrelated third
    parties. Your data stays within the ASpan ecosystem, used only by those who
    need it to operate and improve the service in line with this Policy.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>4. Data Storage and International Transfers</strong></h2>

  <p>
    All personal data collected through ASpan is stored in our
    <strong>AppWrite database</strong>, which is a secure cloud-based datastore.
    Because cloud services can involve servers located in various countries,
    your data
    <strong
      >may be stored and processed on servers outside of your home
      country</strong
    >. In fact,
    <strong>data storage and processing may occur internationally</strong>,
    including (potentially) in countries that have different data protection
    laws than your country of residence.
  </p>
  <p>
    We understand that international data transfers require careful handling
    under privacy laws like the GDPR.
    <strong
      >No matter where your data is processed, we will protect it under the
      terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</strong
    >
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another region
    with data transfer restrictions, we take appropriate safeguards to ensure
    that your personal information remains protected according to EU standards.
    These safeguards may include measures such as
    <strong>standard contractual clauses</strong> or ensuring our service
    providers (like AppWrite) are certified under frameworks that ensure
    adequate data protection. By using ASpan, you acknowledge that your
    information may be transferred to facilities located in other countries, and
    you <strong>consent to such international transfer</strong> for the purposes
    of storage and processing as described here.
  </p>
  <p>
    We retain your personal data on our servers
    <strong>only for as long as necessary</strong> to fulfill the purposes
    outlined in this Policy. In practice, this means we will keep your data
    while your ASpan account is active. If you choose to delete your account (or
    request us to delete your data), or if your account becomes inactive for an
    extended period, we will remove or anonymize your personal information from
    our active databases, subject to our backup procedures and legal obligations
    (see Section 7 on <strong>Your Rights</strong> and Section 8 on
    <strong>Data Security</strong> for more on deletion).
  </p>
  <h2><strong>5. Data Security Measures</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Protecting your data is our priority.</strong> We implement
    industry-standard security measures to safeguard your personal information
    against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Some of
    the key security practices and technologies we use include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Encryption:</strong> All communication between your app/browser
      and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols. This means that
      data (such as your login credentials) is protected in transit and cannot
      be easily intercepted. Additionally, where possible, we utilize encryption
      at rest for stored data in the AppWrite database. For example, sensitive
      fields like passwords are stored using strong one-way cryptographic
      hashing so that they cannot be read or recovered in plain text.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Access Controls:</strong> We restrict access to personal data
      strictly to authorized personnel who need it to operate or maintain the
      service. The AppWrite platform provides robust authentication and
      permission systems, ensuring that each user can only access their own data
      and that our administrators can only access what is necessary for
      maintenance tasks. We use role-based access controls so that no one can
      access user data unless it is required for their job function.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> Our AppWrite database and servers
      are protected by firewalls and regular security monitoring. We apply
      security patches and updates to our software and infrastructure promptly
      to mitigate risks. AppWrite itself is built with security in mind,
      employing measures such as rate limiting (to prevent brute-force attacks)
      and audit logging of significant events.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No Third-Party Exposure:</strong> Because we do not integrate
      external analytics or advertising services, your data isn’t being
      transmitted to third-party networks during normal use of the app. This
      reduces potential vectors for data leaks.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Employee and Contractor Obligations:</strong> (If applicable) Any
      team members or volunteers who help operate ASpan are trained on the
      importance of privacy and are contractually bound to protect user data.
      They must follow strict guidelines and are subject to disciplinary
      measures if they fail to meet our data protection standards.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
    personal information,
    <strong
      >no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure</strong
    >. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. However, we
    continuously review and enhance our security practices to keep your data as
    safe as possible. If there is ever any indication of a data breach that
    affects your personal information, we will notify you and the appropriate
    authorities as required by law.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>6. Your Rights and Choices</strong></h2>

  <p>
    We believe you should have control over your personal data. Subject to
    applicable laws, you have the following
    <strong>rights regarding your information</strong> on ASpan:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Access Your Data:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of
      the personal data we hold about you. We can provide you with a summary of
      your username, email, and any other associated information (such as last
      activity date) upon request.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Rectification (Correcting Your Data):</strong> If any personal
      information we have is incorrect or outdated (for example, if you need to
      update your email address), you have the right to correct it. You can
      update certain information through your account profile (if such an option
      is available) or by contacting us to request changes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Deletion (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You have the right to
      request deletion of your personal data. This can be done by deleting your
      account through the app (if that feature exists) or by contacting us
      directly with a deletion request. Once we verify your identity and
      ownership of the account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data
      from our systems. Please note that we might retain certain minimal
      information if necessary for legal compliance or internal security (for
      example, we may keep a record that an email belonged to a deleted account
      to prevent fraud or re-use of the account inappropriately), but we will
      inform you if any such retention is required.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Data Portability:</strong> For users in some jurisdictions (such
      as the EU under GDPR), you may have the right to request your personal
      data in a common portable format. Upon request, we can provide your basic
      account data in a machine-readable format.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Restriction or Objection to Processing:</strong> In certain
      circumstances, you may have the right to object to or ask us to limit
      (restrict) the processing of your data. For example, if you believe the
      data is inaccurate or our processing is unlawful, you can request limited
      use until the issue is resolved. Since ASpan only processes your data to
      provide our non-profit service, if you object to us processing necessary
      data (like your email or password), it may require that you discontinue
      use of the service. We will inform you of any implications if you seek to
      exercise this right.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Withdraw Consent:</strong> In the unusual case where we rely on
      your consent to process any personal data (for instance, if we ever ask
      for permission for a new feature), you have the right to withdraw that
      consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the legality of
      any processing we carried out prior to your withdrawal. (Note: Currently,
      ASpan does not base its data processing on consent but rather on the need
      to provide the service, except for your acceptance of this Privacy Policy
      and Terms of Use by using the platform.)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>How to Exercise Your Rights:</strong> You can exercise these rights
    at any time by contacting us (see the <strong>Contact Us</strong> section at
    the end of this Policy). For certain requests like data access, we may need
    to verify your identity to ensure we’re providing information to the correct
    person. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in
    accordance with applicable law (typically within 30 days for most requests).
    There is no cost for exercising your rights, though if a request is
    manifestly unfounded or excessive (for example, repetitive requests), we may
    charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on it as permitted by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note, if you delete your data or object to necessary processing,
    <strong>your ability to use ASpan may be impacted</strong>. We’ll always
    explain the consequences of honoring your request (for example, that
    deleting your account will remove access to your saved progress).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, if you have concerns about how we handle your data, you also have
    the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority or
    regulatory body in your country. We encourage you to contact us first so we
    can address your concerns directly.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>7. Children’s Privacy (Users Under 16)</strong></h2>

  <p>
    Protecting the privacy of young users is especially important to us. ASpan
    is intended for a general audience of learners and is
    <strong>not directed primarily at children under the age of 13</strong>. We
    recognize the need to provide further privacy protections for minors under
    16 years old, in line with GDPR-K and COPPA.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>No Sign-Ups Under 13:</strong> We do
      <strong
        >not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children
        under 13 years of age</strong
      >. If you are under 13, please do not register an account or send any
      personal information to us. If we discover that we have collected personal
      data from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will
      delete that information as quickly as possible.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Parental Guidance for Ages 13–16:</strong> If you are between 13
      and 16 years old, you should only use ASpan with the involvement and
      consent of a parent or legal guardian. While we currently do
      <strong>not have a formal process to obtain parental consent</strong>
      during registration, by using our platform we presume that you have
      obtained permission from your parent or guardian to use ASpan and that
      they have reviewed and agreed to this Privacy Policy. We encourage
      parents/guardians of minors using ASpan to supervise their child’s use of
      the platform and educate them about safe online practices.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Parental Rights:</strong> If you are a parent or guardian and you
      believe we have collected personal information from your child under 16
      without appropriate consent, please contact us immediately. We will work
      with you to review, update, or delete the child’s information as required.
      Parents (especially of children under 13) have the right under COPPA to
      request the removal of their child’s personal data from our records. We
      will gladly honor such requests and confirm once the data has been
      deleted.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Educational Context:</strong> If ASpan is ever used in a school or
      educational setting involving students under 16, we expect that the school
      or educator has obtained any necessary parental consents or is acting as
      the agent for the parent (consistent with COPPA’s “school official
      exception”). Regardless, our policy remains not to share or use students’
      personal data for any commercial purposes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By using ASpan, users under 16 acknowledge that they understand the
    importance of privacy and have either reached the age of 16 or have the
    consent and guidance of a parent/guardian. We are committed to complying
    with all applicable laws regarding children’s privacy and will update our
    practices as needed to remain in compliance.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h2>

  <p>
    We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
    changes in our practices, ensure ongoing compliance with relevant laws, or
    for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes,
    we will do the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Notification of Changes:</strong> We will post the updated Privacy
      Policy on our website (and within the app, if applicable) with a new
      <strong>“Last Updated”</strong> date. If changes are significant, we will
      provide a more prominent notice or
      <strong>notify you directly</strong> (for example, by email to the address
      associated with your account or by an in-app message).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Consent to Changes:</strong> If you continue to use ASpan after a
      Privacy Policy update takes effect, you will be deemed to have accepted
      the revised policy. However, if any change requires separate consent by
      law (for example, if in the future we were to collect additional data or
      use it for new purposes that require consent), we will obtain that consent
      from you.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Review and Stay Informed:</strong> We encourage you to
      periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are
      protecting your information. The latest version of the Privacy Policy will
      always be available on our website. Past versions can be requested if you
      wish to see how the policy has evolved.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you do not agree with any updates to the Privacy Policy, you should stop
    using ASpan and may request that your data be deleted (see
    <strong>Your Rights</strong> above). We will not enforce material changes to
    this Privacy Policy retroactively without your express consent.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>9. Contact Information</strong></h2>

  <p>
    We welcome any questions, concerns, or feedback you may have about your
    privacy or this Policy. If you need to contact us for any reason – whether
    it’s to exercise your rights, report a potential issue, or simply ask a
    question about how your information is handled – please reach out to us:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> [Privacy Contact Email Placeholder]</li>

    <li><strong>Mailing Address:</strong> [Legal Address Placeholder]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em
      >(We are in the process of establishing our official contact channels.
      Please use the above placeholder contact information for now – these will
      be updated once our official contact email and legal address are
      finalized.)</em
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Data Controller:</strong> For the purposes of data protection laws,
    the “controller” of your personal information is the ASpan
    team/organization. [If applicable, include the official entity name once
    available.]
  </p>
  <p>
    We will do our best to respond promptly to your inquiries. Your privacy is
    important to us, and we take all complaints or questions seriously. If you
    contact us about a privacy issue, we may ask for verification of identity
    before sharing any information, in order to protect against unauthorized
    access to data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for reading our Privacy Policy. By using ASpan, you place your
    trust in us, and we are committed to honoring that trust by keeping your
    personal information safe and using it responsibly. We hope you enjoy
    learning with ASpan, and we pledge to continue safeguarding your privacy
    every step of the way.
