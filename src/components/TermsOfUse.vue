  <h1><strong>ASpan Terms and Conditions of Service</strong></h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 28, 2025</p>
  <h2><strong>1. Introduction & Acceptance of Terms</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>1.1What ASpan Is:</strong> ASpan is a non-commercial microlearning
    educational platform that provides short, factual, and clear pieces of
    knowledge on various topics. The Service is operated by ASpan, located at
    Kazakhstan, Astana, Seifullin 8 street (referred to in these Terms as
    "ASpan," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using ASpan (including any
    content, functionality, and services offered on or through it),
    <strong
      >you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Service</strong
    >
    (the "Terms"). These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you (the
    user) and ASpan. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms,
    <strong>do not use the Service</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1.2Acceptance of Terms:</strong> Your use of ASpan indicates your
    acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. You understand that these
    Terms may be updated from time to time as described in Section 9 below. In
    addition, ASpan has a separate <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> that
    describes how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. Please
    review the Privacy Policy as it is incorporated by reference into these
    Terms. Using ASpan means you also agree to the Privacy Policy. If you have
    any questions about these Terms, please contact us at
    <strong>[Contact Information]</strong> before using the Service.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>2. Eligibility & User Accounts</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>2.1Age Requirements:</strong> ASpan is intended for users who are
    <strong>12 years of age or older</strong>. By using the Service, you
    represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are under
    the age of majority in your jurisdiction (typically under 18 years old), you
    must have the permission of a parent or legal guardian to use ASpan.
    <strong>Users between 12 and 17 years of age</strong> should review these
    Terms with a parent or guardian, and by using the Service you confirm that
    such review has occurred and that your parent/guardian consents to your use
    of ASpan. If you are
    <strong>under 12 years old, you are not permitted to use ASpan</strong>. We
    reserve the right to request proof of age or parental consent at any time to
    verify compliance with this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2.2 Account Registration:</strong> To access certain features of
    ASpan, you may need to create a user account. When registering an account,
    you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about
    yourself. At a minimum, account registration will require you to choose a
    username and provide a valid email address and a secure password. This
    information, along with a record of your last activity date on the platform,
    will be stored in our database (operated via AppWrite). You agree to keep
    your information up-to-date and to not misrepresent your identity.
    <strong>Accounts are for personal use only</strong> – you may not create an
    account on behalf of someone else without proper authorization, and you may
    not sell, transfer, or license your account to any other person.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2.3 Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining
    the confidentiality of your login credentials and for restricting access to
    your account.
    <strong
      >You assume full responsibility for all activities that occur under your
      account</strong
    >
    (whether or not authorized by you). If you believe your account has been
    compromised or accessed without authorization, you must notify ASpan
    immediately. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your
    failure to safeguard your account information. ASpan reserves the right to
    disable or terminate any account that it suspects is involved in
    unauthorized activity or in violation of these Terms.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>3. Description of Services</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>3.1 Educational Content:</strong> ASpan provides a collection of
    microlearning content designed to help users quickly learn facts and key
    points about a wide range of topics (for example, science, history,
    technology, and more). Each learning module or snippet on ASpan is
    intentionally brief, focusing on clear and factual information that is easy
    to digest. The content on ASpan is generated with the assistance of advanced
    AI (specifically, a GPT-based language model) and is then reviewed and
    fact-checked by our team for accuracy and clarity. We strive to ensure that
    the information presented is reliable and up-to-date. Along with the textual
    content, ASpan includes references or links to factual sources (such as
    articles, textbooks, or reputable websites) so that users can verify
    information and explore the topic further if they wish.
    <strong
      >These source links are provided for transparency and educational
      value</strong
    >, and by clicking them you will be navigating to third-party sites (see
    Section 6 regarding third-party links and our liability).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3.2 Visual Aids:</strong> To enhance the learning experience, ASpan
    supplements text-based content with visual elements, including images and
    graphics. Some of these visuals are generated by artificial intelligence
    tools and others are created by human designers. Notably, ASpan collaborates
    with <strong>Krea AI</strong> for certain AI-generated imagery under a
    formal agreement, which ensures ASpan has the rights to use and display
    those visuals. All visuals are selected or produced to be relevant to the
    educational content and to aid in understanding the material. While the
    visuals are illustrative and intended to reinforce learning, they are not
    meant to be exact representations in every context (for example, an
    AI-generated historical scene is for concept illustration only).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>3.3 Non-Commercial Service:</strong> ASpan is a non-commercial
    platform, meaning that we do not charge users for access to the educational
    content and we are not primarily driven by profit motives. The Service is
    provided for your personal, non-commercial use to support learning. We may
    introduce new features, content, or functional improvements over time to
    better serve our users. Any new features or tools which are added to ASpan
    will also be subject to these Terms. We reserve the right to modify or
    discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Service or any part of it with
    or without notice, though we will endeavor to inform users of significant
    changes in advance when possible.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>4. User Conduct & Restrictions</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>4.1</strong> When using ASpan, you agree to conduct yourself in a
    responsible, respectful manner.
    <strong
      >You must use the Service in compliance with all applicable laws and

    <strong>not</strong> engage in any of the following prohibited activities:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Misrepresentation and Content Modification:</strong> ASpan is
      committed to maintaining the integrity and accuracy of its educational
      content. Users must not misrepresent ASpan’s materials by modifying,
      distorting, or falsifying lesson content (e.g., through screenshots,
      editing, or other manipulations) to present misleading or false
      information. Any attempt to alter ASpan’s educational materials in a way
      that misleads others or portrays the platform in a false or harmful manner
      is strictly prohibited
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Disruption of Service:</strong> Do not disrupt or interfere with
      the normal operation of ASpan. This means you must not attempt to
      interfere with the servers, networks, or infrastructure of the Service
      (for example, by transmitting worms, viruses, malware, or any code of a
      destructive nature). You agree not to initiate any attacks, overload, or
      flood the platform, and not to take any action that imposes an
      unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Do not attempt to gain unauthorized
      access to any portion or feature of ASpan, including other users’
      accounts, or any system or network connected to the Service. This includes
      refraining from hacking, password “mining,” or any other illegitimate
      means of accessing data not intended for you. If you are not explicitly
      authorized to access an area of the Service, you must not try to do so.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No Data Scraping or Mining:</strong> You are expressly prohibited
      from using any automated means (such as scripts, bots, spiders, or
      crawlers) to access, query, or collect information or content from ASpan
      without our prior written permission. This includes
      <strong
        >no web scraping, data mining, or harvesting of content or users’
        information</strong
      >. You also agree not to use the Service or its content in order to
      develop, train, or improve any data-generating or AI model (for example,
      using ASpan content to train another AI) without our explicit consent.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No Reverse Engineering:</strong> You must not copy, decompile,
      reverse engineer, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code or
      underlying ideas or algorithms of any part of ASpan (except as permitted
      by applicable law). This prohibition extends to any software or technology
      used in providing the Service. Tampering with or attempting to probe,
      scan, or test the vulnerability of any ASpan system or network without
      authorization is strictly forbidden.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Unauthorized Use of Content:</strong> ASpan’s content is provided
      for your personal learning. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy,
      sell, trade, resell, or exploit any portion of the Service or content
      obtained through the Service for any commercial purpose. You may not
      remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices displayed on
      the content. (See Section 5 on Intellectual Property for more details on
      content usage rights.)<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Respect for Others:</strong> IDo not collect or store personal
      data about other users without their consent. Any form of cheating,
      plagiarism, or academic dishonesty using the platform’s content is also
      prohibited – use ASpan to learn and educate yourself, not to deceive
      others about your knowledge.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>4.2</strong> Violating any of the above rules
    <strong
      >may result in immediate suspension or termination of your access to
      ASpan</strong
    >
    (see Section 8 on Termination) and may also expose you to civil or criminal
    liability. ASpan reserves the right to investigate any misuse of the Service
    and to cooperate with law enforcement in prosecuting users who violate the
    law. We also reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to monitor your
    use of the Service for compliance with these Terms.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>5. Intellectual Property & Licensing</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>5.1 ASpan Content Ownership:</strong> All content available on ASpan
    – including but not limited to text, articles, explanations, images,
    graphics, illustrations, designs, and the overall compilation and
    arrangement of such content – is the
    <strong>intellectual property of ASpan</strong> or its licensors and is
    protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
    This means ASpan (or our content providers) retains all rights, title, and
    interest in the content and the Service. The
    <strong>microlearning texts</strong> and educational materials on ASpan are
    original works generated and curated by us (with the assistance of AI and
    human fact-checkers), and the <strong>visual elements</strong> (images,
    graphics) are created or obtained by us, including those produced in
    collaboration with <strong>Krea AI</strong> under a formal agreement. Our
    agreement with Krea AI grants ASpan the rights to use and display the
    AI-generated visuals as part of our content. All such materials are
    collectively referred to as "ASpan Content."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.2 Trademarks:</strong> The name <strong>"ASpan"</strong>, our
    logos, and any other ASpan product or service names or slogans that appear
    on the Service are trademarks or service marks of [Company Legal Name]
    (unless otherwise noted). You are not granted any right or license to use
    any of ASpan’s trademarks by these Terms. Any unauthorized use of our
    trademarks is strictly prohibited. Other trademarks, logos, or service marks
    appearing in the Service (for example, names of third-party source sites or
    tools like "Krea AI") are the property of their respective owners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.3 Limited License to Users:</strong> Subject to your compliance
    with these Terms, ASpan grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
    non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service
    <strong>for your personal, non-commercial educational purposes only</strong
    >. This license allows you to view and use the ASpan Content through our
    platform interface.
    <strong>However, this license does not permit you to</strong> do any of the
    following without our prior written consent:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Download, copy, or save ASpan Content to a personal repository (except as
      necessary for caching in your web browser or unless explicitly enabled by
      a download feature on the Service).
    </li>

    <li>
      Reproduce or <strong>redistribute</strong> ASpan Content on any other
      website, app, publication, or platform.
    </li>

    <li>
      Modify, translate, or create derivative works based on ASpan Content (for
      example, you may not take our text or images and alter them to publish
      elsewhere).
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Publish or commercialize</strong> any ASpan Content, i.e., you
      cannot sell, rent, or license our educational materials to others.
    </li>

    <li>
      Remove or obscure any copyright or other proprietary notices contained in
      ASpan or in ASpan Content.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use ASpan Content in a manner that suggests any association with or
      endorsement by ASpan or [Company Name] without our approval.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>5.4</strong> Any use of the Service or content outside the scope of
    the permitted use as set forth in these Terms
    <strong>is strictly prohibited</strong> and will terminate the license
    granted herein. If you wish to use ASpan Content beyond what is allowed by
    these Terms (for example, if a teacher or organization wants to distribute
    materials in a classroom setting or include our content in a presentation),
    please <strong>contact us for permission</strong>. We may be open to certain
    educational uses, but you must obtain written permission from us and comply
    with any licensing terms we provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.5 User-Submitted Content:</strong> (Note: ASpan is primarily a
    one-way content platform, and we do not currently allow users to post their
    own content publicly. If in the future ASpan offers features like user
    comments, contributions, or content sharing, additional terms will govern
    those submissions. For now, this section is to clarify intellectual property
    in ASpan’s content itself.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>5.6 Reservation of Rights:</strong> All rights not expressly granted
    to you in these Terms are reserved by ASpan and its content providers. This
    means that except for the limited license above, you have no additional
    rights or ownership in the content or Service. ASpan may at any time revoke
    the permission to use content if you violate these Terms. Misuse of ASpan’s
    intellectual property may result in legal action, in addition to account
    termination.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>6. Disclaimers & Limitations of Liability</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>6.1 "As Is" Service Disclaimer:</strong> ASpan is provided to you on
    an <strong>"as is" and "as available"</strong> basis. While we are
    passionate about providing high-quality, accurate educational content,
    <strong>ASpan makes no warranty or guarantee</strong> that the Service will
    meet your requirements or expectations.
    <strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law</strong>, ASpan disclaims all
    warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, regarding
    the Service and the content. This includes, but is not limited to, any
    implied warranties of
    <strong
      >accuracy, completeness, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a
      particular purpose, title, non-infringement</strong
    >, or any warranty that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free,
    secure, or free of harmful components (like viruses). We do not warrant that
    any errors or defects in the content will be corrected, although we strive
    to fix mistakes when identified. The educational information provided on
    ASpan is <strong>for general knowledge purposes only</strong> and should not
    be relied upon as professional advice. For example, nothing on ASpan is
    intended to constitute medical, legal, financial, or other professional
    advice specific to your situation. Always consult a qualified professional
    for advice in those areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.2 Content Accuracy:</strong> ASpan’s team works hard to fact-check
    and verify the information presented. However, we
    <strong>do not guarantee</strong> that all content is 100% accurate,
    up-to-date, or error-free. Sources may have inaccuracies or become outdated,
    and AI-generated content can occasionally contain mistakes despite our
    reviews. <strong>Use your judgment</strong> and cross-reference critical
    information with the provided sources or other trusted resources. By using
    ASpan, you understand and agree that any reliance you place on the content
    is <strong>at your own risk</strong>. If you spot an error or have a concern
    about any content, we welcome your feedback so we can improve the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.3 Third-Party Links & Sources:</strong> ASpan content often
    includes links or references to third-party websites and sources (for
    example, a link to a Wikipedia article, scientific journal, or news site for
    further reading or verification). These links are provided for your
    convenience and to enhance your learning. However,
    <strong
      >ASpan has no control over the content or practices of those third-party
      sites</strong
    >. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the
    information, services, or products that third-party websites may offer. Once
    you click a third-party link and leave ASpan,
    <strong>these Terms no longer govern</strong>; any browsing or interaction
    on other websites is subject to that website’s own terms and policies. ASpan
    will not be liable for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of,
    or reliance on, content from third-party sources. We encourage you to review
    the terms and privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.4 Limitation of Liability:</strong>
    <strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law</strong>, in no
    event shall ASpan, or any of our affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
    partners, or licensors be liable for any
    <strong
      >indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</strong
    >
    whatsoever. This includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
    lost data, loss of goodwill, business interruption, or other intangible
    losses arising out of or in connection with (a) your access to, use of, or
    inability to use the Service; (b) any conduct or content of any third party
    on the Service or any linked website; or (c) any content obtained from the
    Service, <strong>even if</strong> ASpan has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.5 </strong>In addition, ASpan’s total cumulative liability for
    <strong>any claims arising out of or related to the Service</strong> or
    these Terms will be
    <strong
      >limited to the greater of the amount (if any) you paid us to use the
      Service in the past six months or USD $50</strong
    >. (Since ASpan is non-commercial and typically free to use, this means our
    liability to you is minimal or zero.) This limitation applies to any claim,
    whether based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence) or
    any other legal theory, and whether or not ASpan has been informed of the
    possibility of such damage.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.6 Exceptions:</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow the
    exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability
    for incidental or consequential damages.
    <strong>If you reside in such a jurisdiction</strong>, some of the above
    limitations may not apply to you to the extent disallowed by applicable law.
    In such cases, ASpan’s liability will be limited to the
    <strong>maximum extent permitted by law</strong>. Nothing in these Terms is
    intended to exclude or restrict any liability that cannot be excluded by law
    (for example, certain statutory warranties or liabilities under applicable
    consumer protection laws).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>6.7 Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold
    harmless ASpan,, its officers, employees, and agents from any claims,
    losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
    that arise out of or relate to your misuse of the Service, violation of
    these Terms, or violation of any law or rights of a third party. We reserve
    the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject
    to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to cooperate with us in
    asserting any available defenses.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>7. Data Collection & Privacy</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>7.1 </strong>Your privacy is important to us. ASpan limits the
    personal data it collects and uses it in accordance with our<a
      href="[https://chatgpt.com/c/67c1e7c1-7b34-8006-bdf0-4ee92fd50fce#](https://chatgpt.com/c/67c1e7c1-7b34-8006-bdf0-4ee92fd50fce#)"
    >
      Privacy Policy</a
    >
    (see that document for full details).
    <strong
      >By using ASpan, you agree to the collection and use of data as described
      here and in the Privacy Policy.</strong
    >
    Below is a summary of what data we collect and how we handle it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Personal Information Collected:</strong> When you create an
      account on ASpan, we collect certain information from you. This includes a
      username (which may or may not be your real name), your email address, and
      a password. We also log the date of your last activity on the platform
      (e.g., the last time you logged in or used the Service). This information
      is stored securely in our backend database (powered by AppWrite). We do
      <em>not</em> require more sensitive personal details like physical address
      or phone number for basic use of the Service. ASpan is designed to gather
      minimal personal data necessary for account management and providing the
      Service.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Use of Collected Data:</strong> The information we collect is used
      for the following general purposes: to create and manage your user account
      (for instance, your email and password are used for login authentication
      and account recovery); to communicate with you (we might send
      service-related announcements or respond to support inquiries to your
      email); to personalize your experience (for example, remembering your
      progress or preferences); and to improve ASpan (using aggregated usage
      data to understand how the platform is used). We do
      <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information to third parties. We
      may share data with service providers or partners who assist us in
      operating ASpan (such as our database host, email service, analytics
      provider, etc.), but only under strict obligations that they protect your
      data and only use it for the purposes we specify.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Data Security:</strong> We take reasonable measures to protect the
      information you provide to ASpan from unauthorized access or disclosure.
      Passwords are stored in an encrypted form (hashed) and we use security
      best practices to safeguard the database. However, no website or Internet
      transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
      security. You also play a role in security by keeping your login
      credentials confidential (see Section 2 on Account Security).<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> For full information on how we handle
      user data—including details on cookies and analytics (if any), data
      retention practices, and your rights regarding your personal
      information—please review our Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is a
      separate document that is considered part of these Terms. If there is any
      conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy regarding personal
      data, the terms of the Privacy Policy will prevail for privacy matters. By
      accepting these Terms, you also agree to the terms of the Privacy
      Policy.<br />
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Parental Consent for Minors:</strong> If you are a parent or
      guardian of a user under 18 (especially for users 12-13 where parental
      consent may be legally required), by allowing your child to use ASpan, you
      consent to ASpan’s collection and use of the child’s information as
      described above and in the Privacy Policy. We do not knowingly collect
      personal data from children under 12, and if we become aware of an account
      registered by someone under 12 without verifiable parental consent, we
      will take steps to delete that account and information.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>7.2</strong> If you have questions about our data practices or wish
    to exercise any rights you may have regarding your personal data (for
    example, requesting deletion of your account data), please refer to the
    Privacy Policy for contact details and procedures.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>8. Termination of Service</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>8.1 By ASpan:</strong> ASpan reserves the right to
    <strong>suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time</strong
    >, for any reason, and without prior notice. This may include termination or
    suspension of individual accounts or of the Service as a whole. Some
    examples of situations where we might terminate or suspend access include:
    if you violate these Terms (or any other policies or guidelines related to
    ASpan), if we detect behavior that is unlawful or that poses a security
    risk, if required by law enforcement or other government agencies, or if we
    discontinue the Service. ASpan shall not be liable to you or any third party
    for any termination of your account or access to the Service. If your
    account is terminated due to a violation of these Terms, you may be barred
    from creating a new account or accessing ASpan in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>8.2 By You:</strong> You have the right to stop using ASpan at any
    time. If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so by using any
    account deletion feature provided in the Service (if available) or by
    contacting us directly with a request to delete your account. Termination of
    your account will typically involve deactivating your profile and removing
    your personal data from active use. Please note that some residual data
    (such as logs or backups) may remain in our systems for a short period after
    termination, but will be purged according to our data retention policies as
    outlined in the Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>8.3 Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon any termination of your
    access, whether initiated by you or by ASpan,
    <strong>your right to use the Service will immediately cease</strong>. You
    must cease all use of ASpan content and delete any downloaded or saved
    content obtained from the Service (if any) in your possession. ASpan may, in
    its sole discretion, remove or discard any content or data associated with
    your account. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive
    termination (such as Intellectual Property rights, Disclaimers, Limitation
    of Liability, Governing Law, and Dispute Resolution) will continue to apply
    even after your access to the Service has been terminated.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>9. Amendments to Terms</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>9.1 Right to Update:</strong> ASpan may revise or update these Terms
    from time to time. We may do this to reflect changes in our Service,
    accommodate new technologies or features, comply with legal requirements, or
    for other valid reasons. Whenever we update the Terms, we will change the
    "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. In the case of
    <strong>material changes</strong> (significant alterations to your rights or
    obligations under the Terms), we will make reasonable efforts to notify you
    in advance. Notification may occur through the Service (for example, via a
    prominent notice on our website or app) or via other communication methods
    (for example, sending an email to the address associated with your account).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>9.2 Your Responsibilities:</strong> It is your responsibility to
    review these Terms periodically for any changes. We encourage you to check
    the Terms whenever you receive notice of an update or whenever you use the
    Service, to stay informed about the rules that apply to you.
    <strong
      >Continued use of ASpan after an updated version of the Terms has been
      posted</strong
    >
    (and after any required notice period for material changes) constitutes your
    acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree with any amendment to the
    Terms, you should discontinue use of the Service and, if necessary,
    terminate your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>9.3 Interim Changes:</strong> In some cases, ASpan might introduce
    new features or offers that come with their own supplemental terms. If any
    supplemental terms apply, we will present those to you at the relevant time
    (for example, when you opt to use that feature), and those terms will become
    part of your agreement with us if you use the feature. In the event of a
    conflict between these Terms and any supplemental terms, the supplemental
    terms will govern with respect to the specific feature or situation to which
    they apply.
  </p>
  <h2><strong>10. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</strong></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>10.1 Governing Law:</strong> These Terms and your use of ASpan are
    governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
    <strong>[Country/State/Region]</strong>,
    <strong>without regard to its conflict of law principles</strong>. This
    means that the law of the specified jurisdiction will apply to any issues or
    disputes relating to these Terms or the Service, even if you reside in a
    different jurisdiction. However, we recognize that you may have mandatory
    consumer rights under the laws of your own country.
    <strong
      >Nothing in this section is intended to limit your rights as a consumer
      under the laws of your local jurisdiction</strong
    >
    when those laws apply mandatorily. In any case, the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) does not
    apply to these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.2 Initial Dispute Resolution:</strong>
    <strong>If you have a dispute or concern</strong> regarding ASpan or these
    Terms, we encourage you to contact us first and attempt to resolve the issue
    informally. Many concerns can be resolved quickly through our support team
    without formal proceedings. You can reach out to us at
    <strong>[Contact Email/Address]</strong> with a brief written description of
    your issue and your contact information. We will attempt in good faith to
    resolve the dispute through discussions with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.3 Formal Dispute Resolution:</strong> In the event that we are
    unable to resolve a dispute informally, the following provisions will apply:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Jurisdiction and Venue:</strong> Subject to any applicable laws
      that mandate otherwise, you agree that any legal suit, action, or
      proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the use of the
      Service shall be brought exclusively in the courts of
      <strong>[Jurisdiction]</strong>. You consent to the jurisdiction of and
      venue in such courts and waive any objection that such courts are an
      inconvenient forum. (If ASpan chooses to include an arbitration clause or
      a different dispute resolution mechanism in the future, this section will
      be updated accordingly. As of now, disputes will be handled in court
      unless otherwise agreed by both parties.)
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Time Limit to File Claims:</strong> To the extent permitted by
      law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of
      ASpan or these Terms must be filed within
      <strong>one (1) year</strong> after such claim or cause of action arose.
      If a claim is not filed within this time frame, it shall be permanently
      barred, which means you will not have the right to pursue it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>10.4 Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held
    to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent
    jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent
    permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full
    force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
    modified in a manner that is valid and enforceable and most closely matches
    the original intent of the provision.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.5 No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or
    provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of that right or
    provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only
    if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of ASpan.
    <strong>No waiver</strong> of any term hereof shall be deemed a further or
    continuing waiver of such term or any other term.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.6 Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms (along with the Privacy
    Policy and any other legal notices or guidelines posted on the Service)
    constitute the <strong>entire agreement</strong> between you and ASpan
    regarding your use of the Service. It supersedes any prior agreements,
    understandings, or communications (whether oral or written) between you and
    us concerning the same subject matter. You acknowledge that you have not
    relied on any representation, warranty, or statement not expressly set out
    in these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.7 Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer your rights
    or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our prior written
    consent. ASpan may assign or transfer its rights and obligations under these
    Terms freely to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or
    sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.8 Headings:</strong> The section titles and headings in these
    Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>10.9 Contact Information:</strong> If you have any questions,
    concerns, or feedback regarding these Terms or the Service itself, you can
    contact ASpan at <strong>[Contact Email]</strong> or by mail at
    <strong>[Company Address]</strong>. We value our users and will do our best
    to address your inquiry promptly.
